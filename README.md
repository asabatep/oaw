# üöÄ OAW (Observatorio de Accesibilidad Web)

A web accessibility tracker and analysis platform.

## ‚ö° Quick Start

On a machine with Docker and Docker Compose installed, clone this repository and run:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

Please be patient‚Äîthe build process and initial database population may take several minutes.

Once the application is running, access it at: [http://localhost:8080/oaw](http://localhost:8080/oaw)  
Login with:

- **Username:** `admin`

### üíª OAW (Java Web Application)

The OAW application is structured into several Maven modules:

- `common`: Common utility functions.
- `crawler`: Web crawler implementation.
- `intavcore`: Core analysis engine.
- `oaw`: Parent project for building the full system.
- `portal`: Web front-end for the Accessibility Observatory.

#### üèóÔ∏è Build Instructions

1. Install Java 8 and Maven 3.
2. Update the following configuration files to match your environment:

   - `oaw/pom.xml` ‚Äî Path to Tomcat installation.
   - `portal/profiles/desarrollo/context.xml` ‚Äî Database connection settings.
   - `portal/profiles/desarrollo/mail.properties` ‚Äî Mail configuration.

3. Compile the project:

```bash
mvn clean install -P desarrollo -DskipTests
```

The resulting `.war` file will be located in the `portal/target` directory.

### üîÑ Motor JS (Proxy Rendering Service)

The `motor-js` directory contains a three-part proxy rendering system:

- `proxy`: Entry point that listens for HTTP/S requests.
- `nginx`: Forwards incoming requests to the rendering service and handles HTTPS.
- `renderer`: Runs [Prerender](https://github.com/prerender/prerender) to render requested web pages and return the HTML content.

### üìä WCAG EM Tool (Customized Report Tool)

The `wcagemtool` directory contains a custom version of the [WCAG-EM Report Tool](https://github.com/w3c/wcag-em-report-tool), modified to allow exporting results in a custom ODS (OpenDocument Spreadsheet) format.
